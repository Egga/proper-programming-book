# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This project aims to publish what we Software Crafters believe to be important
  to know about Proper Programming Today. When we have enough material we want
  it to be printed as a book that can be given to newcomers. For the greater
  good of code bases around the world.
