We have created a space to gather material that we want to be published.

1. This is public, because we are proud of the words we say and the actions we take,
2. This is free, because we want this to be accessible to anyone everywhere.
3. This is not really, fully, entirely planned through yet but more of an idea, what we want to achieve in the long
   run...

... but do not be discouraged, my friend. We are experts on TDD (Test Driven Design) and do fast iterations with small
commits guiding us along the requirements towards our goals.

### How do you Run a Marathon?

One step at a time. At every point of the journey you make a single step. 80cms left, 80cms right. And repeat. If
you do enough consecutive steps you cross the finish line. There is not a single person in the world that can run a
marathon in a single step.
