This is a test to demonstrate an unpublished draft. It will be visible when using
> bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts

1. This is public, because we are proud of the words we say and the actions we take,
2. This is free, because we want this to be accessible to anyone everywhere.
3. This is not really, fully, entirely planned through yet but more of an idea, what we want to achieve in the long
   run...

... but do not be discouraged, my friend. We are experts on TDD (Test Driven Design) and do fast iterations with small
commits guiding us along the requirements towards our goals.
